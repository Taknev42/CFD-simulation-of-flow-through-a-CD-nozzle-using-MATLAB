# CFD-simulation-of-flow-through-a-CD-nozzle-using-MATLAB
Simulation of subsonic and subsonic-supersonic Isentropic compressible flow through a Converging-Diverging Nozzle using MATLAB. The Inviscid Euler equations are solved using the explicit MacCormack Scheme.

There are three cases that have been covered in this project. The main files are Subsonic_case1.m, Subsonic_case2.m, and Supersonic.m files. Rest all are function files which have been defined for convenience. The Euler equations have been solved in the conservation form instead of solving for the primitive variables. 

This project was done as part of a course project for ME 605: Computational Fluid Dynamics.
