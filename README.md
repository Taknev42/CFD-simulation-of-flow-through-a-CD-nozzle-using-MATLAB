# CFD-simulation-of-flow-through-a-CD-nozzle-using-MATLAB
Simulation of subsonic and subsonic-supersonic Isentropic compressible flow through a Converging-Diverging Nozzle using MATLAB. The Inviscid Euler equations are solved using the explicit MacCormack Scheme.

This project was done as part of a course project for ME 605: Computational FLuid Dynamics.
